relations in the dataset

SIO_000628	- refers to - 	refers to is a relation between one entity and the entity that it makes reference to. 

SIO_001119	- gene-disease association linked with causal mutation -	A gene-variant disease association in which a mutation in the gene/protein results in the development or maintenance of the disease.
SIO_001120	- therapeutic gene-disease association -	A gene disease association in which the gene is a therapeutic marker for the disease.
SIO_001121	- gene-disease biomarker association -	A gene-disease association in which the gene/protein is involved in the etiology or maintenance of the disease.
SIO_001122	- gene-disease association linked with genetic variation -	A gene-disease association in which a sequence variation (a mutation, a SNP) is associated with the disease.
SIO_001343	- gene-disease association linked with susceptibility mutation -	A gene-disease association in which a germline mutation in the gene predisposes to the development of the disease, and it is necessary but not sufficient for the manifestation of the disease.
SIO_001344	- gene-disease association linked with germline causal mutation -	A gene-variant disease association in which a germline mutation in the gene/protein results in the development or maintenance of the disease, and it may be passed on to offspring.
SIO_001345	- gene-disease association linked with somatic causal mutation -	A gene-variant disease association in which a somatic mutation in the gene/protein results in the development or maintenance of the disease, and it may not be passed on to offspring.
SIO_001346	- gene-disease association linked with somatic modifying mutation -	A gene-variant disease association in which a somatic mutation in the gene modifies the clinical presentation of the disease, and it may not be passed on to offspring.
SIO_001347	- gene-disease association linked with germline modifying mutation -	A gene-variant disease association in which a germline mutation in the gene modifies the clinical presentation of the disease, and it may be passed on to offspring.
SIO_001348	- fusion gene-disease association -	A gene-disease association in which the fusion between two different genes (promotor and/or other coding DNA regions) is associated with the disease.
SIO_001349	- gene-disease association linked with chromosomal rearrangement -	A gene-disease association in which the gene is included in a chromosomal rearrangement associated with a particular manifestation of the disease
