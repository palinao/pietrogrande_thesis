Classic late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (LINCL) is a neurodegenerative disease in which autofluorescent "curvilinear" storage bodies accumulate in tissues from affected patients. Recently, the LINCL gene (CLN2) has been found to code for a pepstatin-insensitive lysosomal protease whose activity is deficient in LINCL specimens. We report the first 2 cases of successful prenatal testing for LINCL by using DNA and enzyme-based methods on amniocytes, and describe a new private mutation in one of the families analyzed. These approaches allow definitive prenatal diagnosis and represent a significant improvement over previous pathological methods.
