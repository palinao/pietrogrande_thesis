In Ullrich-Turner syndrome (UTS) patients, the presence of a Y-chromosome or Y-derived material has been documented in frequencies ranging from 4-61%. Mutations of SRY (testis-determining gene) constitute the cause of XY sex reversal in approximately 10-15% of females with pure gonadal dysgenesis. Most of these mutations have been described in the HMG (high mobility group) box of the gene, which is the region responsible for DNA binding and bending; however, various mutations outside the HMG box have been reported. We carried out molecular studies of the SRY gene in three patients with a UTS phenotype and bilateral streaks; two presented a 45,X/46,XY mosaic, and the third a Y marker chromosome. In two patients a missense mutation, S18N, was identified in the 5' non-HMG box region in DNA from blood and both streaks; this mutation was not identified in 75 normal males. Sequencing of the DNA region of interest was normal in the father and older brother of patient 1, demonstrating that in this patient the mutation was de novo. A previous report of a 46,XY patient with partial gonadal dysgenesis who presented the same mutation as our patients indicates the probable existence of a hot spot in this region of the SRY gene and strengthens the possibility that all gonadal dysgeneses constitute part of a spectrum of the same disorder. It also demonstrates that a single genetic abnormality can result in a wide range of phenotypic expression.
