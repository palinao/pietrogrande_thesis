Hypophosphatasia is a rare inherited disorder characterized by defective bone mineralization and deficiency of serum and liver/bone/kidney-type alkaline phosphatase (L/B/K ALP) activity. We report the characterization of tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP) gene mutations in a series of 12 families affected by severe or mild hypophosphatasia. Twenty distinct mutations were found, 5 of which were previously reported. Nine of the 15 new mutations were missense mutations (T117N, A159T, R229S, A331T, H364R, D389G, R433H, N461I, and C472S). The others were 2 nonsense mutations (L-12X and E274X), one single nucleotide deletion (1256delC), 2 mutations affecting splicing (298-2A>G, 997+2T>A), and a mutation in the major transcription start site (-195C>T).
