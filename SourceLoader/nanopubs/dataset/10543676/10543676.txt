We report a 46,XY infant with an M807T mutation in his androgen receptor that abrogated cellular responses to testosterone, but not to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), resulting in ambiguous genitalia. Treatment with a topical DHT gel restored male genital development allowing the infant to be reared in accordance with his chromosomal sex.
