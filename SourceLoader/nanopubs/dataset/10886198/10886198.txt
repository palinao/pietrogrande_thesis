Factor VIII gene analysis in a large consanguinous Danish family comprising 24 affected males and four homozygously affected females revealed an Asn694Ile mutation within the A2 domain. The factor VIII gene mutation led to a mild haemophilia A phenotype with factor VIII function displaying discordance between one-stage clotting and chromogenic two-stage assays. In one-stage assays, values ranged from 0.05 to 0.30 IU/ml (males) and from 0.19 to 0.29 IU/ml (homozygous affected females), whereas the chromogenic two-stage assay produced values of around only 50% of the one-stage result [0. 02-0.12 IU/ml (males); 0.06-0.10 IU/ml (females)]. The differences are suggested to be caused by the effect of the mutation on the active cleaved form of the factor (F)VIII protein. As the original amino acid (Asn) is conserved in all known FVIII A2 sequences, but not in ceruloplasmin, we suggest that Asn694 is involved in an A2-specific functional role. Examination of a homology model of the A domains predicts that the Asn694Ile mutation (i) results in the loss of two potential hydrogen-bonding interactions and (ii) hampers the integration of the bulky side-chain of Ile into the A2 domain core, probably causing an altered stability and/or folding of the protein. Interestingly, the disease in this Danish family was originally proposed to be von Willebrand-JÃ¼rgens disease. However, the current study rules out the co-existence of either von Willebrand's disease or the presence of the Normandy variant of von Willebrand factor (type 2N).
