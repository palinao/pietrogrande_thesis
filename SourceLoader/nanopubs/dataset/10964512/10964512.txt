The activity of succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid CoA transferase (SCOT; locus symbol OXCT; EC 2.8.3.5) is the main determinant of the ketolytic capacity of tissues. Hereditary SCOT deficiency causes episodic ketoacidosis. Here we describe the human SCOT gene, which spans more than 100 kb and contains 17 exons, on chromosome 5p13. We report pathogenic missense mutations in three SCOT-deficient patients designated GS04, 05, and 06. GS04 is a G219E/G324E compound; GS05 is a V221M homozygote, and GS06 is a G324E homozygote. We constructed a tertiary structural model of human SCOT by homology modeling based on the known structure of Acidaminococcus fermentans glutaconate CoA transferase. The model predicts that V221 and G219 are on the dimerizing surface, whereas G324 is near the active site. SCOT activity was reduced to a comparable degree in all three patients, but in a transient expression assay in SCOT-deficient fibroblasts, cDNAs containing G219E and G324E produced no detectable activity, whereas V221M constructs yielded approximately 10% of the control peptide level and detectable specific activity. Interestingly, GS05 had the mildest clinical course reported to date and detectable levels of SCOT protein in fibroblasts.
