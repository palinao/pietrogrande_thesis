Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a group of inherited disorders of host defense caused by a mutation in any of the four components of phagocyte NADPH oxidase, namely gp91-, p22-, p47-, and p67-phox. We have made a precise statistical analysis of 229 registered patients from 195 families in Japan and mutation analysis of 28 and 5 independent patients, respectively, with gp91- and p22-phox deficiency. The gp91- and p22-phox proteins form the membrane cytochrome b558, which plays important roles in the assembly of the active oxidase and electron-transfer reaction, and the lesions in either subunit account for more than 80% of cases. The ratio of male to female patients was 6.6/1, the incidence was calculated to be about 1 out of 220,000 birth, and the life expectancy of the patients born in the 1970s was estimated to be 25-30 years old. For the X-linked gp91-phox deficiency, we found five missense and nine nonsense mutations, seven deletions, three insertions, and four splice site mutations, which included the following novel mutations: four missense, five nonsense, six deletions, one insertion, and two splice site abnormalities. With regard to p22-phox deficiency, two homozygous nonsense mutations and one homozygous deletion, a missense mutation together with a splice site mutation, and two different missense mutations were found. These mutations have not been reported before. Based on the present and reported data from Japan, we discuss the molecular defects of the disease and the difference in statistics between western countries and Japan.
