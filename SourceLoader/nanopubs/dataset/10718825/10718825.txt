Pendred's syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by goitre, sensorineural deafness and iodide organification defect. It is one of the most frequent causes of congenital deafness, accounting for about 10% of hereditary hearing loss. It is caused by mutations in the pendrin (PDS) gene, a 21 exon gene located on chromosome 7. The aim of this study was to examine an Italian family affected with Pendred's syndrome at the molecular level.
