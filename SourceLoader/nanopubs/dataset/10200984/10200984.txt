Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is one of the most common genetic diseases in humans, affecting 1 out of 1000 individuals. At least three different genes are involved in this disease. The search for mutations in PKD1 is complicated because most of the transcript is encoded by a genomic region reiterated more proximally on chromosome 16, and no prevalent mutation has been reported.
