Thirty newly detected mutations in the PHEX gene are reported, and pooled with all the previously published mutations. The spectrum of mutations displayed 16% deletions, 8% insertions, 34% missense, 27% nonsense, and 15% splice site mutations, with two peaks in exon 15, and 17. Since 32.8% of PHEX amino acids were conserved in the endopeptidases family, the number of missense mutations detected at non-conserved residues was smaller than expected, whereas the number of nonsense mutations observed at non-conserved residues was very close to the expected number. Compared with conserved amino acids, the changes in non-conserved amino acids may result in benign polymorphisms or possibly mild disease that may go undiagnosed.
