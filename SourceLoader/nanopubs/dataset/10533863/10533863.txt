A low concentration of HDL cholesterol is the most common lipoprotein abnormality in patients with premature atherosclerosis. We have shown that Tangier disease, a rare and severe form of HDL deficiency characterised by a biochemical defect in cellular cholesterol efflux, is caused by mutations in the ATP-binding-cassette (ABC1) gene. This gene codes for the cholesterol-efflux regulatory protein (CERP). We investigated the presence of mutations in this gene in patients with familial HDL deficiency.
