Mutations in the JAGGED1 gene are responsible for the Alagille syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by neonatal jaundice, intrahepatic cholestasis, and developmental disorders affecting the liver, heart, vertebrae, eyes, and face. We screened a large group of patients for mutations in JAGGED1 and studied transmission of the mutations.
