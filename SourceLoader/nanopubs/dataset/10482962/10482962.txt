The purpose of this work was to test the hypothesis that mutations in the putative glucose 6-phosphate translocase gene would account for most of the cases of GSD I that are not explained by mutations in the phosphohydrolase gene, ie that are not type Ia. Twenty-three additional families diagnosed as having GSD I non-a (GSDIb, Ic or Id) have now been analysed. The 9exons of the gene were amplified by PCR and mutations searched both by SSCP and heteroduplex analysis. Except for one family in which only one mutation was found, all patients had two allelic mutations in the gene encoding the putative glucose 6-phosphate translocase. Sixteen of the mutations are new and they are all predicted to lead to non-functional proteins. All investigated patients had some degree of neutropenia or neutrophil dysfunction and the clinical phenotype of the four new patients who had been diagnosed as GSD Ic and the one diagnosed as GSD Id was no different from the GSD Ib patients. Since these patients, and the four type Ic patients from two families previously studied, shared several mutations with GSD Ib patients, we conclude that their basic defect is in the putative glucose 6-phosphate translocase and that they should be reclassified as GSD Ib. Isolated defects in microsomal Pi transporter or in microsomal glucose transporter must be very rare or have phenotypes that are not recognised as GSD I, so that in practice there are only two subtypes of GSD I (GSD Ia and GSD Ib).
