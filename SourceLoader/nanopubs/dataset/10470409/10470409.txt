Mutations of the androgen receptor gene in genetic males cause a variety of androgen insensitivity syndromes varying from female phenotype through intersexuality to male phenotype with infertility. The identification of a missense mutation in the steroid-binding domain in an infertile male with mild features of androgen insensitivity is reported here.
