The authors present two new missense mutations in exon 1 of the adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) gene. The first, a C813T transition, results in the substitution Pro143 Ser in the third putative transmembrane domain of the adrenoleukodystrophy protein (ALDP) in an adult onset case. The second, a de novo C709T transition, results in a substitution Ser 108 Leu between the second and the third putative transmembrane segments, in a childhood case.
