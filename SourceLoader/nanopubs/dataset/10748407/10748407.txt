Glycogen storage disease type Ia (GSD-Ia) is an autosomal recessive disorder of glycogen metabolism caused by a deficiency of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) that is expressed in the liver, kidney, and intestinal mucosa. Clinical manifestations include short stature, hepatomegaly, hypoglycemia, hyperuricemia, and lactic acidemia. To elucidate a spectrum of the G6Pase gene mutations and their frequencies, we analyzed mutations in 51 unrelated Japanese patients with GSD-Ia. The most prevalent mutation was g727t, accounting for 88 of 102 mutant alleles examined, followed by R170X mutation, which accounted for 6 mutant alleles, and R83H mutation which was observed in 3 mutant alleles. In addition, 3 different, novel mutations, IVS1-1g<a, Gly122-to-Asp (G122D) and His179-to-Pro (H179P), were identified. We were able to detect "ectopically" transcribed G6Pase-mRNA in Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cells and observed aberrant mRNA splicing associated with the g727t and IVS1-1g<a mutations. To our knowledge, this is the first report that ectopic expression can be utilized for the characterization of GSD-Ia mutations. Our findings suggest that a screening for the g727t, R170X, and R83H mutations by simple DNA-based diagnostic methods can detect 95% of the G6Pase mutant alleles in Japanese patients with GSD-Ia, and remaining mutations can be identified and characterized by the direct sequencing of genomic DNA and/or the analysis of ectopically expressed mRNA. The noninvasive molecular diagnosis for GSD-Ia may ultimately replace the conventional means of enzymatic diagnosis that requires liver biopsy.
