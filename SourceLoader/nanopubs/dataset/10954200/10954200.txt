We recently published the precise chromosomal localization on chromosome 16p13.1 of the genetic defect underlying pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE), an inherited disorder characterized by progressive calcification of elastic fibers in skin, eye, and the cardiovascular system. Here we report the identification of mutations in the gene encoding the transmembrane transporter protein, ABC-C6 (also known as MRP-6), one of the four genes located in the region of linkage, as cause of the disease. Sequence analysis in four independent consanguineous families from Switzerland, Mexico, and South Africa and in one non-consanguineous family from the United States demonstrated several different mis-sense mutations to cosegregate with the disease phenotype. These findings are consistent with the conclusion that PXE is a recessive disorder that displays allelic heterogeneity, which may explain the considerable phenotypic variance characteristic of the disorder.
