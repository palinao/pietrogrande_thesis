We have used long-range PCR to identify mutations in the duplicated part of the PKD1 gene. By means of a PKD1-specific primer in intron 1, an approximately 13.6-kb PCR product that includes exons 2-15 of the PKD1 gene has been used to search for mutations, by direct sequence analysis. This region contains the majority of the predicted extracellular domains of the PKD1-gene product, polycystin, including the 16 novel PKD domains that have similarity to immunoglobulin-like domains found in many cell-adhesion molecules and cell-surface receptors. Direct sequence analysis of exons encoding all the 16 PKD domains was performed on PCR products from a group of 24 unrelated patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD [MIM 173900]). Seven novel mutations were found in a screening of 42% of the PKD1-coding region in each patient, representing a 29% detection rate; these mutations included two deletions (one of 3 kb and the other of 28 bp), one single-base insertion, and four nucleotide substitutions (one splice site, one nonsense, and two missense). Five of these mutations would be predicted to cause a prematurely truncated protein. Two coding and 18 silent polymorphisms were also found. When, for the PKD1 gene, this method is coupled with existing mutation-detection methods, virtually the whole of this large, complex gene can now be screened for mutations.
