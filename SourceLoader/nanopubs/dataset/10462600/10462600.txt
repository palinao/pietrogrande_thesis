The continued identfication of new mutations in the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) gene is important in correlating the genotype/phenotype of patients with classic homocystinuria and in assessing whether heterozygosity of CBS deficiency is an important cause of mild hyperhomocysteinemia, an independent risk factor for occlusive vascular diseases.
