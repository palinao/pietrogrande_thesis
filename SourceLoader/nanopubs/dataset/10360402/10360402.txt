The platyspondylic lethal skeletal dysplasias (PLSDs) are a heterogeneous group of short-limb dwarfing conditions. The most common form of PLSD is thanatophoric dysplasia (TD), which has been divided into two types (TD1 and TD2). Three other types of PLSD, or TD variants (San Diego, Torrance, and Luton), have been distinguished from TD. The most notable difference between TD and the variants is the presence of large rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) inclusion bodies within chondrocytes of the variants. We examined 22 cases of TD variants for the presence of missense mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene. All 17 cases of the San Diego type (PLSD-SD) were heterozygous for the same FGFR3 mutations found in TD1. No mutations were identified in the Torrance and Luton types. Large inclusion bodies were found in all 14 cases of PLSD-SD. Similar inclusion bodies were present in two of 72 TD1 cases, but not in 39 controls. The material retained within the rER stained only with antibody to the FGFR3 protein. The radiographic and morphologic differences between TD and PLSD-SD may be a consequence of other genetic factors, perhaps in the processing of mutant FGFR3 molecules within the rER. The presence of rER inclusion bodies cannot reliably discriminate between closely related skeletal dysplasias.
