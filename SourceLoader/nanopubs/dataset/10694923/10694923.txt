Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is a rare, mostly X-linked recessive disorder characterized by renal tubular resistance to the antidiuretic effect of arginine vasopressin. The gene responsible for the X-linked NDI, the G-protein-coupled vasopressin V2 receptor, has been localized on the Xq28 region. In this study we present three NDI families from Hungary with three different missense mutations in the vasopressin V2 receptor gene. After the mutations in the affected probands in each family had been characterized, other family members were screened by restriction enzyme analysis. The N317K and W323S mutations have not been detected previously. The C112R is an already known mutation. The N317K was a de novo mutation in the patient. The C112R and the W323S were found in the mothers of the patients as carriers and in all other patients, but not in the unaffected members of the families. Segregation of the mutations was consistent with the clinically observed symptoms as well as their severity. As conclusion, these findings further evidence that X-linked NDI results from defects in the V2 receptor gene.
