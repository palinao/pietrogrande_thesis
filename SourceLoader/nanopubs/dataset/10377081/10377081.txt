Congenital long-QT syndrome (LQTS) is an inherited condition of abnormal cardiac excitability characterized clinically by an increased risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. One form, LQT3, is caused by mutations in the cardiac voltage-dependent sodium channel gene, SCN5A. Only 5 SCN5A mutations have been associated with LQTS, and more work is needed to improve correlations between SCN5A genotypes and associated clinical syndromes.
