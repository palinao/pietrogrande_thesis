Five point mutations (R88H, R88P, T118I, 959delT, R468Q) previously identified in the iduronate-2-sulfatase (IDS) gene of Italian Hunter patients were expressed in COS cells to evaluate their functional consequence on enzyme activity, processing and intracellular localization. The 88 arginine residue belongs to the CXPSR pentapeptide conserved in all human sulfatases, where cysteine modification to formylglycine is required for enzyme activity. Substitution of arginine with histidine residue resulted in 13.7% residual enzyme activity, with an apparent K(m) value (133 microM) lower than that found for the normal enzyme (327 microM), indicating a higher affinity for the substrate; substitution of arginine with proline resulted in total absence of residual activity, in agreement with the phenotypes observed in patients carrying R88H and R88P mutations. For the four missense mutations, pulse-chase labelling experiments showed an apparently normal maturation; however, subcellular fractionation demonstrated poor transport to lysosomes. Therefore, residues 88, 118 and 468 appear to be not essential for processing but important for IDS conformation.
