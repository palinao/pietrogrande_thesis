Hunter disease (mucopolysaccharidosis type II or MPS II) is an X-linked recessive disorder caused by the deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme iduronate-2-sulfatase (IDS) (E.C.3.1.6.13.) involved in the catabolism of mucopolysaccharides dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate. A large variety of alterations have been detected at the IDS locus. We report here the identification, in 7 unrelated Italian patients, of IDS gene mutations, four of which are novel and have been confirmed by amplification refractory system (ARMS) or restriction analysis. Our findings include: the missense mutation P86L found in a severe phenotype, the splicing mutation G374G and the nonsense mutation W475X, both associated with mild phenotypes. The four novel mutations were: the missense mutations R88P and R88H, associated with severe phenotypes, concerning a position found to be a mutational "hot-spot" for the IDS gene due to a mutation-prone CpG dinucleotide; mutations T1181 and P266H, both in mild patients. Interestingly, four of our mutations are located on exon III of IDS gene, confirming the high mutation frequency of this exon. After this manuscript was submitted, Rathman et al (Am. J.Hum.Genet.59,1202,1996) reported a total of 101 mutations including one R88H which is one of the novel mutations in this report.
