Glycogen storage disease type Ib is caused by a mutation in the gene encoding microsomal glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) transporter. We determined the exon/intron organization of the G6P transporter gene. Four overlapping genomic fragments containing the entire coding region of the gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using exonic primers, and their nucleotide sequences were determined. The gene spans 4.5 kb and has eight exons. All exon/intron boundaries adhered to the canonical AG/GT rule. We then designed eight pairs of PCR primers to amplify all coding exons for a mutational analysis and studied five Japanese patients with the disease. Two novel homozygous mutations were identified in two families: a three-base deletion (delV235) in exon 2 in a consanguineous family and a splicing mutation (IVS7+1G-->T) in intron 7 in a nonconsanguineous family. Patient 3 was a compound heterozygote of W118R and IVS1+1G-->A, both of which we previously identified [Kure et al., 1998: Biochem Biophys Res Commun 248:426-431]. Patients 4 and 5 were homozygotes of W118R. Including our previous study, we found a total of ten W118R alleles in nine Japanese patients. The results support our previous suggestion that W118R is prevalent among Japanese patients. The genomic sequence data and mutation spectrum obtained from the Japanese patients will facilitate genetic diagnosis of glycogen storage disease type Ib.
