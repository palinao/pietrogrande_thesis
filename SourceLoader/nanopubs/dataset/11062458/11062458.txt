Primary hypomagnesaemia is composed of a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by renal or intestinal Mg(2+) wasting, often associated with disturbances in Ca(2+) excretion. We identified a putative dominant-negative mutation in the gene encoding the Na(+), K(+)-ATPase gamma-subunit (FXYD2), leading to defective routing of the protein in a family with dominant renal hypomagnesaemia.
