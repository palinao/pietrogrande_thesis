Recent reports have shown that the autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP) phenotype linked to the pericentric region of chromosome 8 is associated with mutations in a gene designated RP1. Screening of the whole gene in a large cohort of patients has not been undertaken to date. To assess the involvement and character of RP1 mutations in adRP, the gene was screened in a panel of 266 unrelated patients of British origin and a Pakistani family linked to this locus.
