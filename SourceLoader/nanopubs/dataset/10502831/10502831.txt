A deletion of at least 11.5 cM in the paternal X chromosome mapping between microsatellites DXS989 and DXS1003 and encompassing the genes for ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator (RPGR) and dystrophin, was associated with the loss of band Xp21 in a female patient with OTC deficiency. Another four female patients were heterozygous for point mutations in the OTC gene: the nonsense mutation Q69X or the missense mutations I172F, G188V and G197R. In the OTC amino acid sequence, I172 and G197 are proximate to residues involved in catalysis, and G188 is within a loop joining helix 5 and strand 6 in the core of the ornithine-bindingdomain. Therefore, the mutations of these residues may cause structural changes affecting catalysis and/or the architecture of the ornithine domain. The mutation appeared "de novo" in the patients or, in one case, in the mother of the patient, in agreement with the predominance of "de novo" mutations in female patients of OTC deficiency. There was full agreement between the results of mutational analysis and of allopurinol testing in the patients and their female relatives, supporting the value of the allopurinol test in the detection of carriers of OTC deficiency. This deficiency is a genetically heterogeneous X-linked condition.
