Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) is linked genetically to mutations in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes. Because a deficiency in MMR does not predict a specific phenotype, the original selection criteria may be too restrictive in identifying additional families. The current study was performed to determine whether a relaxation of the Amsterdam criteria (AC) could be applied to identify more families associated with DNA MMR.
