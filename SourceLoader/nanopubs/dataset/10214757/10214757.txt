We found the association of a heterozygous novel MPZ gene point mutation, Ile62Phe in exon 2, with autosomal dominant motor and sensory neuropathy with focally folded myelin sheaths. Family study revealed that de novo Ile62Phe mutation on the MPZ gene occurred in the proband and was inherited by her children with early onset slowly progressive neuropathy. Our study suggests that the characteristic pathologic findings of the sural nerve in these patients are closely related to the site and nature of amino acid substitutions of the MPZ gene.
