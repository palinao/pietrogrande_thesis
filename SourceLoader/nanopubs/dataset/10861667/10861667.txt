Congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA), a rare and severe disorder, comprises absence of sensation to noxious stimuli, inability to sweat, and recurrent episodes of hyperthermia. It has a relatively high prevalence in the consanguineous Israeli-Bedouins. Clinical studies of 28 patients are reported here. Using the linkage analysis approach, we linked the disease in 9 of 10 unrelated Israeli-Bedouin families with CIPA to the TrkA gene, which encodes the receptor for nerve growth factor. In one family, linkage was excluded, implying that another gene, yet unidentified, is involved. Two new mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the TrkA gene were identified in our CIPA patients: a 1926-ins-T in most of the southern Israeli-Negev CIPA patients, and a Pro- 689-Leu mutation in a different isolate of Bedouins in northern Israel. Eight prenatal diagnoses were made in the southern Israeli-Negev Bedouins, two by linkage analysis and six by checking directly for the 1926-ins-T mutation. Three polymorphisms in the TrkA protein kinase encoding domain were also observed.
