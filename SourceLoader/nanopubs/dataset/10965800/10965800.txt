Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1 B (CMT1B) is a demyelinating neuropathy caused by mutations in the myelin protein zero (P0) gene (MPZ). A few cases of CMT1B were recently found to be characterized by focally folded myelin sheaths in nerve biopsy specimens; the significance of this association is unknown. Here, we describe two unrelated pedigrees harboring a heterozygous Ser49Leu substitution in P0ex. In both pedigrees, the mutation caused a late-onset, relatively mild CMT1B; in one pedigree, two patients had atrophy of peroneal muscles but hypertrophy of the gastrocnemius muscles. The sural nerve biopsy performed in the two index cases revealed an identical chronic demyelinating and remyelinating neuropathy dominated by focal foldings of the myelin sheath shaped either as tomacula or as out/infoldings. The report adds Ser49Leu to the mutations of P0ex associated with focally folded myelin and provides strong evidence that such a structural alteration of the myelin sheath reflects a distinct pathogenetic mechanism in a subgroup of CMT1B.
