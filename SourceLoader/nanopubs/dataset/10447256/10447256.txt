DNA sequence analysis of the protein S gene (PROS1) in 22 Spanish probands with type I or III PS deficiency, has allowed the identification of 10 different mutations and 2 new sequence variants in 15 probands. Nine of the mutations, 8 of which are novel, cosegregate with type I or quantitative PS deficiency in 12 of the 13 pedigrees analyzed. One of these mutations (Q238X) also cosegregates with both type I and III PS-deficient phenotypes coexisting in a type I/III pedigree. Another mutation identified in a pedigree with these two PS phenotypes is the missense mutation R520G, present in the homozygous form in the type I propositus and in the heterozygous form in his type III relatives. By contrast, no cosegregating PROS1 mutation has been found in any of the six families with only type III phenotypes. Three of these families, as well as the two families with type I and I/III phenotypes where no other PROS1 mutation has been identified, segregate the P allele of the S460P variant, although this allele does not always cosegregate with the deficient phenotype. From these results we conclude that while mutations in PROS1 are the main cause of type I PS deficiency, the molecular basis of the type III phenotype is probably more complex, with many cases not being explained by a PROS1 mutation.
