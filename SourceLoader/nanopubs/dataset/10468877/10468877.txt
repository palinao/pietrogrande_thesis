We report a new family with hereditary factor X deficiency. The propositus had a markedly prolonged prothrombin time, a mild prolongation of activated partial thromboplastin time and a clotting time activated by Russell's viper venom. Factor X activity in plasma was 3 u/dl (normal range 56-138 u/dl). Factor X antigen level was 61 u/dl. Molecular analysis revealed a homozygous mutation, Glu (GAG) to Gln (CAG) at residue 32 which normally undergoes gamma-carboxylation within the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid rich domain. The genotypes of family members completely correlated with their factor X activities. It is suggested that the Glu32 to Gln mutation is the molecular basis for the abnormal factor X in this family.
