Primary dysrhythmias other than those associated with the long QT syndrome, are increasingly recognized. One of these are represented by patients with a history of resuscitation from cardiac arrest but without any structural heart disease. These patients exhibit a distinct electrocardiographic (ECG) pattern consisting of a persistent ST-segment elevation in the right precordial leads often but not always accompanied by a right bundle branch block (Brugada syndrome). This syndrome is associated with a high mortality rate and has been shown to display familial occurrence.
