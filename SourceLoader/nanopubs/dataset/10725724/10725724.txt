MHC class II deficiency or bare lymphocyte syndrome is a severe combined immunodeficiency caused by defects in MHC-specific regulatory factors. Fibroblasts derived from two recently identified bare lymphocyte syndrome patients, EBA and FZA, were found to contain novel mutations in the RFX-B gene. RFX-B encodes a component of the RFX transcription factor that functions in the assembly of multiple transcription factors on MHC class II promoters. Unlike RFX5- and RFXAP-deficient cells, transfection of exogenous class II transactivator (CIITA) into these RFX-B-deficient fibroblasts resulted in the induction of HLA-DR and HLA-DP and, to a lesser extent, HLA-DQ. Similarly, CIITA-mediated induction of MHC class I, beta2-microglobulin, and invariant chain genes was also found in these RFX-B-deficient fibroblasts. Expression of wild-type RFX-B completely reverted the noted deficiencies in these cells. Transfection of CIITA into Ramia cells, a B cell line that does not produce a stable RFX-B mRNA, resulted in induction of an MHC class II reporter, suggesting that CIITA overexpression may partially override the RFX-B defect.
