Mutations in the PKD1 gene account for approximately 85% of cases with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD1; MIM# 601313), which is considered one of the most frequent monogenic disorders, with a frequency of approximately 1:1000. The main symptom is the formation of fluid-filled cysts in the kidneys and less often in other organs, such as the liver and pancreas. Since the cloning of the gene many mutations have been identified, although the screening is hampered by several unique features of this gene, the most significant one being that approximately 70% of the sequence at the 5'-end, is reiterated elsewhere on chromosome 16 with homology approaching 95%. Here, we used an oligonucleotide primer anchored in the unique part in exon 34, paired with a forward primer in exon 23 for specifically amplifying PKD1 sequences. We screened for mutations in samples from 32 Hellenic ADPKD families. We detected seven sequence variants, five of which most probably are single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), especially useful for linkage analysis and disease association studies. One is a missense change, segregating with ADPKD in one family. The last one is a missense non-conservative change, H2921P, which appeared de novo in the proband, concurrently with the disease phenotype, and was passed on to another two generations. Two siblings who inherited the same haplotype as the proband, but not the de novo mutation, were not affected. This is only the fourth case of a molecularly documented de novo mutation in ADPKD. Somatic mosaicism in peripheral blood leukocytes of the proband was tested and excluded. Hum Mutat 16:176, 2000.
