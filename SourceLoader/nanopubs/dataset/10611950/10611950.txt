A matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time-of-flight (MALDI/TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) system was used to detect variant transthyretin (TTR) in immunoprecipitated serum TTR molecules obtained from 6 patients with familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) who were already proven not to have ATTR Val30Met. This simple and quick method showed six different patterns of mass spectra of TTR-related immunoprecipitates from these patients, and in each patient the clearly identified characteristic doublet-shaped ion peaks consisted of normal and variant TTR apart from each other peak with a mass difference between them. DNA sequencing confirmed that the patterns of variant TTR corresponded respectively to ATTR Val30Leu, ATTR Phe33Val, ATTR Asp38Ala, ATTR Ser50Arg, ATTR Ala97Gly and ATTR Ala97Ser. ATTR Asp38Ala and ATTR Ala97Ser are previously unknown variants of TTR leading to the development of FAP. ATTR Phe33Val was found in a Chinese FAP patient and ATTR Ala97Ser in a Taiwanese. Serum analysis using immunoprecipitation and MALDI/TOF MS system can provide useful information when investigating FAP patients with diverse types of variant TTR.
