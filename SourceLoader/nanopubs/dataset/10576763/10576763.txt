Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is a syndrome of endocrine tumors involving the parathyroids, anterior pituitary and enteropancreatic neuroendocrine tissues, and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Recently, the gene responsible for this syndrome, MEN1, was positionally cloned in 11q13. We aimed to assess the significance of MEN1 gene diagnostics in families with MEN1.
