D-bifunctional protein is involved in the peroxisomal beta-oxidation of very long chain fatty acids, branched chain fatty acids and bile acid intermediates. In line with the central role of D-bifunctional protein in the beta-oxidation of these three types of fatty acids, all patients with D-bifunctional protein deficiency so far reported in the literature show elevated levels of very long chain fatty acids, branched chain fatty acids and bile acid inter-mediates. In contrast, we now report two novel patients with D-bifunctional protein deficiency who both have normal levels of bile acid intermediates. Complementation analysis and D-bifunctional protein activity measurements revealed that both patients had an isolated defect in the enoyl-CoA hydratase domain of D-bifunctional protein. Subsequent mutation analysis showed that both patients are homozygous for a missense mutation (N457Y), which is located in the enoyl-CoA hydratase coding part of the D-bifunctional protein gene. Expression of the mutant protein in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae confirmed that the N457Y mutation is the disease-causing mutation. Immunoblot analysis of patient fibroblast homogenates showed that the protein levels of full-length D-bifunctional protein were strongly reduced while the enoyl-CoA hydratase component produced after processing within the peroxisome was undetectable, which indicates that the mutation leads to an unstable protein.
