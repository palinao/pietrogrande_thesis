Lipoprotein glomerulopathy (LPG) is characterized by intraglomerular lipoprotein thrombosis and high plasma concentrations of apolipoprotein (apo) E. An apo E variant, apo E2 (Arg145Pro) Sendai, was recently identified in three patients with LPG. We detected a novel point mutation in the apo E gene in a patient with LPG, and we characterized the mutant apo E.
