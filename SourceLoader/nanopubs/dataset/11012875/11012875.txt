Mutations of PKD1 are thought to account for approximately 85% of all mutations in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). The search for PKD1 mutations has been hindered by both its large size and complicated genomic structure. To date, few mutations that affect the replicated segment of PKD1 have been described, and virtually all have been reported in Caucasian patients.
