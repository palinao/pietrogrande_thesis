Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) is an autosomal, dominantly inherited cancer syndrome, with tumours in various endocrine glands. In 1997 the responsible tumour suppressor gene was identified. MEN1 gene germ-line mutations are detected in the vast majority of MEN 1 patients, however, with regard to case-finding, unfortunately only at a very low frequency in patients with apparently sporadic MEN 1-related tumours. In order to increase the detection rate of disease gene carriers among patients with apparently sporadic MEN 1-related tumours, clinical criteria were needed.
