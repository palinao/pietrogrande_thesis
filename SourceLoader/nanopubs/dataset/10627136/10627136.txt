Van Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) is an autosomal dominantly inherited disorder, characterised by the development of clear cell renal carcinomas, CNS hemangioblastomas, retinal angiomas, pancreatic tumors, pheochromocytomas and hepatic cysts. Recently a number of families with dominant familial pheochromocytoma as the only clinical manifestation have been reported to carry mutations in the HVL gene. We describe a family in which a novel VHL S68W mutation was segregating and carrier individuals manifested with variable penetrance of isolated pheochromocytomas. Investigation of this kindred confirmed that a mutation in the VHL gene could produce isolated pheochromocytomas as the only clinical feature and was variably penetrant.
