Thiamine responsive megaloblastic anemia (TRMA) is an autosomal recessive disorder with a triad of symptoms: megaloblastic anemia, deafness, and non-type 1 diabetes mellitus. Occasionally, cardiac abnormalities and abnormalities of the optic nerve and retina occur as well. Patients with TRMA often respond to treatment with pharmacological doses of thiamine. Recently, mutations were found in patients with TRMA in a thiamine transporter gene (SLC19A2). We here describe the mutations found in eight additional families. We found four novel mutations and three that were previously described. Of the novel ones, one is a nonsense mutation in exon 1 (E65X), two are missense mutations in exon 2 (S142F, D93H), and another is a mutation in the splicing donor site at the 5' end of intron 4 (C1223+1G>A). We also summarize the state of knowledge on all mutations found to date in TRMA patients. SLC19A2 is the first thiamine transporter gene to be described in humans. Reviewing the location and effect of the disease causing mutations can shed light on the way the protein functions and suggest ways to continue its investigation.
