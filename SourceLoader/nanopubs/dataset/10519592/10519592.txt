The authors describe two cases of isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency found in one family. This is a rare autosomal-recessive disorder presenting at birth with seizures, severe neurologic disease, and ectopia lentis. It can be easily missed with metabolic screening; however, the finding of lens subluxation stresses the importance of ophthalmic assessment in making the diagnosis.
