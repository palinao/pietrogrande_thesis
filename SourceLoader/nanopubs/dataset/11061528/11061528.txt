Presented is a cohort study to assess the nature and frequency of thyroid peroxidase (TPO) mutations in 45 patients (35 families) with congenital hypothyroidism due to a total iodide organification defect; incidence is 1:66,000 in The Netherlands. The presentation is consistently similar with a severe form of congenital hypothyroidism and also characterized by a complete and immediate release of accumulated radioiodide from the thyroid after sodium perchlorate administration. Sixteen different mutations were found, including eight novel mutations; the majority occurs in exons 8, 9, or 10. The GGCC insertion in exon 8 at nucleotide 1277, leading to an early termination signal in exon 9, is the most frequently occurring mutation. These mutations were detected in 29 families in both TPO alleles (13 homozygous and 16 compound heterozygous). In one family, partial maternal isodisomy of 2p was detected, in four families only one mutated TPO allele could be detected, and in one family no inactivating TPO mutation could be found. Because all patients clearly had the clinicopathologic features of a total iodide organification defect, we conclude that in these five families the mutations in the (other) alleles could be either located in the intronic sequences or in the promoter region. Mutations in the TPO gene result in total iodide organification defects.
