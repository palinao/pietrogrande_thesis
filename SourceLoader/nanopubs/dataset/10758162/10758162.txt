A 5-week-old male infant presented with severe bacterial infections and poor wound healing, suggesting a neutrophil defect. Neutrophils from this patient exhibited decreased chemotaxis, polarization, azurophilic granule secretion, and superoxide anion (O(2)(-)) production but had normal expression and up-regulation of CD11b. Rac2, which constitutes >96% of the Rac in neutrophils, is a member of the Rho family of GTPases that regulates the actin cytoskeleton and O(2)(-) production. Western blot analysis of lysates from patient neutrophils demonstrated decreased levels of Rac2 protein. Addition of recombinant Rac to extracts of the patient neutrophils reconstituted O(2)(-) production in an in vitro assay system. Molecular analysis identified a point mutation in one allele of the Rac2 gene resulting in the substitution of Asp57 by an Asn (Rac2(D57N)). Asp57 is invariant in all defined GTP-binding proteins. Rac2(D57N) binds GDP but not GTP and inhibits oxidase activation and O(2)(-) production in vitro. These data represent the description of an inhibitory mutation in a member of the Rho family of GTPases associated with a human immunodeficiency syndrome.
