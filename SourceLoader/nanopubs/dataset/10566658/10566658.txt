Pseudovitamin D deficiency rickets (PDDR) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by defect in the activation of vitamin D. We recently isolated 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 1alpha-hydroxylase gene and identified four homozygous inactivating missense mutations in this gene by analysis of four typical cases of PDDR. This disease shows some phenotypic variation, and it has been suspected that patients with mild phenotypes have mutations that do not totally abolish the enzyme activity. To investigate the molecular defects associated with the phenotypic variation, we analyzed six additional unrelated PDDR patients: one with mild and five with typical clinical manifestation. By sequence analysis, all six patients were proven to have mutations in both alleles. The mutations varied, and we identified four novel missense mutations, a nonsense mutation, and a splicing mutation for the first time. The patient with mild clinical symptoms was compound heterozygous for T321R and a splicing mutation. The splice site mutation caused intron retention. Enzyme activity of the T321R mutant was analyzed by overexpressing the mutant 1alpha-hydroxylase in Escherichia coli cells to detect the subtle residual enzyme activity. No residual enzyme activity was detected in T321R mutant or in the other mutants. These results indicate that all of the patients, including those of mild phenotype, are caused by 1alpha-hydroxylase gene mutations that totally abolish the enzyme activity.
