Two forms of autosomal-dominant lattice corneal dystrophy (LCD), types I and IIIA, have previously been shown to be caused by different mutations within the transforming growth factor, beta-induced (TGFBI) gene. A clinical and molecular analysis of three unrelated kindreds with a clinically distinct late-onset LCD was undertaken to determine whether this phenotype is also caused by mutations within the TGFBI gene.
