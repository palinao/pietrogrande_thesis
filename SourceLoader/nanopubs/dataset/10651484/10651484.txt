Germ-line mutations in the p16/CDKN2 gene are known to predispose to melanoma. This gene belongs to a family of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and blocks G1-S progression. The occurrence of p16/CDKN2 germline mutations in 12 Icelandic melanoma kindreds (kindreds with two or more cases of melanoma or melanoma, pancreas and/or glioma cases) was examined. No germ-line mutation was found, however five mutations not previously discribed in solid tumours were identified, Pro48Leu, Ala57Val, Gly89Asp, Leu117Met, Tyr129Stop.
