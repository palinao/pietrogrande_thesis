Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC), an inherited liver disease of childhood, is characterized by cholestasis and either normal or increased serum gamma-glutamyltransferase activity. Patients with normal gamma-glutamyltransferase activity have mutations of the FIC1 locus on chromosome 18q21 or mutations of the BSEP gene on chromosome 2q24. Also, patients with bile acid synthesis defects have low gamma-glutamyltransferase activity. We investigated expression of the bile salt export pump (BSEP) in liver samples from patients with a PFIC phenotype and correlated this with BSEP gene mutations.
