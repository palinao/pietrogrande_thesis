We report the clinical and molecular data of 16 patients with RSH/Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (RSH/SLOS) with varying phenotypic severity, for which we have identified mutations in both alleles. RSH/SLOS is an autosomal recessive malformation syndrome caused by mutations in the gene encoding the sterol Delta(7)-reductase. This protein catalyzes the reduction of 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholesterol in the last step of cholesterol biosynthesis via the Kandutsch-Russell pathway. In addition to previously reported mutations (T93M, L109P, G147D, W151X, T154M, R242C, A247V, T289I, IVS8-1G-->C, Y408H, and E448K), we have identified six previously undescribed mutations (321G-->C, W177R, R242H, Y318N, L341P, and C444Y). We also report rapid polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays developed to detect four of the recurring mutations (T93M, W151X, V326L, and R404C) and six other RSH/SLOS mutations (321G-->C, L109P, T154M, T289I, Y318N, and L341P). The purpose of this article is to correlate detailed clinical information with molecular data in order to improve our understanding of the genotype-phenotype correlation of RSH/SLOS and to report the development of PCR-based assays that will allow more rapid mutation analysis.
