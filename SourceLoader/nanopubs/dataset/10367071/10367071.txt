The congenital long QT syndrome (QTL) is a heterogenic clinical and genetic entity characterised by prolongation of the QT interval which may be complicated by syncope and sudden death. Four genes have been identified for the cardiac potassium (KCNQ1, HERG and KCNE1) and sodium (SCN5A). The aim of this study was to assess the prognosis of the disease by the site of mutation identified on the morbid gene. Thirty-two genotyped families participated to this study. Each subject gave a clinical history, an ECG and a search for genetic mutation. Eighteen mutations in the transmembrane domains of KCNQ1 were identified in 25 families and 2 mutations in the C-terminal part were found in 4 families. The phenotype was less severe in C-terminal part mutations: less syncopes and sudden deaths (22 vs 55%, p < 0.001) and a shorter QTc (458 +/- 31 ms vs 479 +/- 31 ms, p = 0.0003). Three mutations were detected in the C-terminal part of HERG in 3 different families. Their phenotype was less severe with syncoped related to hypokalemia. The authors also report the case of a family in which two subjects who were the most severely affected had two mutations, one in HERG and the other in KCNQ1. This study confirms the value of a genetic research in assessing the severity of the congenital long QT syndrome.
