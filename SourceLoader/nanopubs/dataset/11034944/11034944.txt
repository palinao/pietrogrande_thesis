Mutations in the gene that encode cardiac troponin T (cTnT) account for approximately 15% of cases of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). These mutations are associated with a particularly severe form of HCM characterized by a high incidence of sudden death and a poor overall prognosis, despite subclinical or mild left ventricular hypertrophy.
