The most common cause of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a mutation in the hepatic nuclear factor 1alpha (HNF1alpha) gene (MODY3). We describe a family in which a missense mutation causing a Thr-Ile substitution at codon 620 has been found in all affected members. The mutation is not fully penetrant as two family members aged 87 and 46 have the mutation but do not have diabetes. The severity and age of diagnosis of diabetes varies widely within the family, and most presented over the age of 25. HNF1alpha mutation screening should be considered in any family with autosomal dominant inheritance of diabetes where one member has presented with diabetes before the age of 25. Predictive testing is now possible within the majority of MODY families, and is of clinical benefit, but the possibility of non-penetrance should be addressed during counselling and interpretation of results.
