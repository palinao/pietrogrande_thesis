In pancreatitis, a key role has been attributed to the inappropriate conversion of trypsinogen to trypsin. Recently, two mutations of the cationic trypsinogen gene were found in families with hereditary pancreatitis. This study was conducted to determine the spectrum and frequency of cationic trypsinogen mutations in unrelated patients with idiopathic or hereditary chronic pancreatitis (CP).
