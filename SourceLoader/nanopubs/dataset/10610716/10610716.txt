Acid ceramidase (AC) is the lysosomal enzyme that degrades ceramide into sphingosine and fatty acid. A deficiency in human AC activity leads to the lysosomal storage disorder, Farber disease (FD). The human AC gene (HGMW-approved symbol ASAH) was cloned and characterized, revealing an organization similar to that of the murine AC gene. The human gene spans about 30 kb in length and contains 14 exons ranging in size from 46 to 1201 bp. The exon/intron junctions were determined and found to follow the GT-AG rule. The putative promoter region had a GC content over 60%, lacked a TATA box, and contained several sequences matching transcription factor binding sites, including nine SP-1 sites, one AP-1 site, and three CACC boxes. The promoter activity of a 475-bp fragment from within this region was demonstrated by chloramphenicol acyltransferase assays. Northern blotting revealed variable expression of the human AC RNA; i.e., expression of the major 2.4-kb transcript was high in heart and kidney, followed by lung and placenta, but low in pancreas, liver, brain, and skeletal muscle. Two minor AC transcripts of 1.7 and 1.2 kb also were detected in heart and skeletal muscle. The human AC gene was mapped to the chromosomal region 8p21.3-p22 by in situ hybridization and FISH analyses, syntenic with the mouse chromosomal location. Finally, three new missense mutations, E138V, R254G, and P362R, were identified in the human AC gene from FD patients. Mutant AC cDNAs containing these point mutations were constructed and examined using the FLAG-tagged expression system. Although the levels of protein expression for these mutant ACs were about equivalent to that of the controls, their enzymatic activity was markedly reduced, confirming their authenticity.
