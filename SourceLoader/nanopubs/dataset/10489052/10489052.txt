The peripheral myelin protein-22 (PMP22) gene has four transmembrane domains, two extracellular loops, and a short cytoplasmic tail. Its roles in the peripheral nervous system remain unclear. The most common cause of Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type 1A (CMT1A) is a PMP22 gene duplication. Missense point mutations in the transmembrane domains are rare alternative causes that have undetermined pathogenetic mechanisms.
