Autosomal dominant Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD-AD) is a disorder characterized clinically by humeropelvic weakness, contractures, and cardiomyopathy, and genetically by mutations in the lamin A/C gene on 1q21.2-q21.3. Of the 14 lamin A/C gene mutations reported thus far, the four involving the rod domain have been associated with isolated cardiomyopathy and conduction-system disease. This is the first report of rod domain mutations in patients with the full EDMD-AD phenotype.
