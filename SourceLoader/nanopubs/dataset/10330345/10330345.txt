Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) with deafness is clinically distinct among the genetically heterogeneous group of CMT disorders. Molecular studies in a large family with autosomal dominant CMT and deafness have not been reported. The present molecular study involves a family with progressive features of CMT and deafness, originally reported by Kousseff et al. Genetic analysis of 70 individuals (31 affected, 28 unaffected, and 11 spouses) revealed linkage to markers on chromosome 17p11.2-p12, with a maximum LOD score of 9.01 for marker D17S1357 at a recombination fraction of .03. Haplotype analysis placed the CMT-deafness locus between markers D17S839 and D17S122, a approximately 0.6-Mb interval. This critical region lies within the CMT type 1A duplication region and excludes MYO15, a gene coding an unconventional myosin that causes a form of autosomal recessive deafness called DFNB3. Affected individuals from this family do not have the common 1.5-Mb duplication of CMT type 1A. Direct sequencing of the candidate peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) gene detected a unique G-->C transversion in the heterozygous state in all affected individuals, at position 248 in coding exon 3, predicted to result in an Ala67Pro substitution in the second transmembrane domain of PMP22.
