Mutations of the DAX1 gene (Dosage-sensitive sex reversal-Adrenal hypoplasia congenita critical region on the X chromosome gene 1), which encodes a novel orphan nuclear receptor, have been identified in patients with X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita (AHC) and hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism (HHG). We have investigated two kindreds with AHC and HHG for DAX1 mutations.
