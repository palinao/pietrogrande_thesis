The study of the molecular bases of thrombophilia in a large family with 4 symptomatic members is reported. Three thrombophilic genetic components (FV R506Q, FV H1299R, and PT 20210G/A), all affecting the activity of the prothrombinase complex, were detected alone and in combination in various family members. In addition, a newly identified missense mutation (factor V [FV] Y1702C), causing FV deficiency, was also present in the family and appeared to enhance activated protein C (APC) resistance in carriers of FV R506Q or FV H1299R by abolishing the expression of the counterpart FV allele. The relationships between complex genotypes, coagulation laboratory findings, and clinical phenotypes were analyzed in the family. All symptomatic family members were carriers of combined defects and showed APC resistance and elevated F1 + 2 values. Evidence for the causative role of the FV Y1702C mutation, which affects a residue absolutely conserved in all 3 A domains of FV, factor VIII, and ceruloplasmin, relies on (1) the absolute cosegregation between the mutation and FV deficiency, both in the family and in the general population; (2) FV antigen and immunoblot studies indicating the absence of Y1702C FV molecules in plasma of carriers of the mutation, despite normal levels of the FV Y1702C messenger RNA; and (3) molecular modeling data that support a crucial role of the mutated residue in the A domain structure. These findings help to interpret the variable penetrance of thrombosis in thrombophilic families and to define the molecular bases of FV deficiency. (Blood. 2000;96:1443-1448).
