We have identified a novel hereditary fructose intolerance mutation in the aldolase B gene (i.e. liver aldolase) that causes an arginine-to-glutamine substitution at residue 303 (Arg(303)-->Gln). We previously described another mutation (Arg(303)-->Trp) at the same residue. We have expressed the wild-type protein and the two mutated proteins and characterized their kinetic properties. The catalytic efficiency of protein Gln(303) is approx. 1/100 that of the wild-type for substrates fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and fructose 1-phosphate. The Trp(303) enzyme has a catalytic efficiency approx. 1/4800 that of the wild-type for fructose 1,6-bisphosphate; no activity was detected with fructose 1-phosphate. The mutation Arg(303)-->Trp thus substitution impairs enzyme activity more than Arg(303)-->Gln. Three-dimensional models of wild-type, Trp(303) and Gln(303) aldolase B generated by homology-modelling techniques suggest that, because of its larger size, tryptophan exerts a greater deranging effect than glutamine on the enzyme's three-dimensional structure. Our results show that the Arg(303)-->Gln substitution is a novel mutation causing hereditary fructose intolerance and provide a functional demonstration that Arg(303), a conserved residue in all vertebrate aldolases, has a dominant role in substrate binding during enzyme catalysis.
