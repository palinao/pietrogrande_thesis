Sequencing of HFE exons 2, 3, 4, and 5, and of portions of introns 2, 4, and 5 revealed novel mutations in four of twenty hemochromatosis probands who lacked C282Y homozygosity, C282Y/H63D compound heterozygosity, or H63D homozygosity. Probands 1 and 2 were heterozygous for previously undescribed mutations: exon 2, nt 314T-->C (314C; I105T), and exon 2, nt 277G-->(277C; G93R), respectively; these probands were also heterozygous for H63D and C282Y, respectively. Probands 3 and 4 were heterozygous for a previously described but uncommon HFE mutation: exon 2, nt 193A-->T (193T; S65C). Proband 3 was also heterozygous for C282Y and had porphyria cutanea tarda, and Proband 4 had hereditary stomatocytosis. Each of these four probands had iron overload. In each proband with an uncommon HFE coding region mutation, I105T, G93R, and S65C occurred on separate chromosomes from those with the C282Y or H63D mutations. Neither I105T, G93R, nor S65C occurred as spontaneous mutations in our probands. The I105T and G93R mutations were linked to haplotypes bearing HLA-A3,-B7 and HLA-A2,-B62, respectively. The S65C mutation was linked to a haplotype characterized by HLA-32. Sixteen other probands did not have an uncommon HFE exon mutation. In 176 normal control subjects, two were heterozygous for S65C, but I105T and G93R were not detected. Nine of twenty probands were heterozygous and two probands were homozygous for a previously described base-pair change at intron 2, nt 3671T-->C. One proband without a detectable missense mutation had a previously described intron 5 allele (nt 6700G-->A). Heterozygosity for a previously described base-pair change in intron 4 (nt 5636T-->C) was detected in all persons we studied who also had the S65C mutation. One proband was heterozygous for a previously undescribed base-pair change at intron 5 (nt 5807A-->G). We conclude that uncommon HFE exon and intron mutations may be discovered among hemochromatosis patients who have "atypical" HFE genotypes.
