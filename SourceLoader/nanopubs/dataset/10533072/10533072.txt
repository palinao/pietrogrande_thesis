The majority of mutations identified in patients with Metachromatic leucodystrophy are unique to individual families. We report here a new mutation in the arylsulphatase A gene (D281Y) identified in a patient with late-onset Metachromatic leucodystrophy. This mutation was inherited in cis with the common pseudo-deficiency allele and in trans with the previously described I179S (250100.0008) mutation which complicated the enzymatic diagnosis of this condition. Sequence comparison shows D281 to be highly conserved amongst the arylsulphatases. The clinical features of this patient which are predominantly of a slowly progressive psychiatric and intellectual deterioration rather than rapid neurological impairment are typical of I179S compound heterozygotes.
