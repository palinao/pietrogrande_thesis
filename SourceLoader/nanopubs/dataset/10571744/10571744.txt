Pachyonychia congenita type 2 (PC-2), also known as Jackson-Lawler type PC, is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by hypertrophic nail dystrophy associated with focal keratoderma and multiple pilosebaceous cysts. It has been demonstrated that PC-2 is associated with germline mutations in the keratin 17 (K17) gene and in its expression partner keratin 6b. In this report, we describe a novel germline mutation in K17, M88T, in a family with PC-2.
