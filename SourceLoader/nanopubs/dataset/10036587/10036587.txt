A sixty-three year old French man presented with isolated late-onset amyloid cardiomyopathy proven by endomyocardial biopsy. There was no known family history of amyloidosis. Immunohistochemistry of cardiac deposits suggested that amyloi fibrils were derived from transthyretin. DNA sequencing revealed a point mutation in exon 2 of the transthyretin gene responsible for a novel amyloidogenic variant Asp42.
