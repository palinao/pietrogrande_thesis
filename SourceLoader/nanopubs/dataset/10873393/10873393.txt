The investigation of 14 unrelated patients with nonketotic hyperglycinemia led to the identification of mutations in 4 cases. Patients were initially categorized into probable P- or T-protein defects of the glycine cleavage enzyme complex, by the use of the glycine exchange assay without supplemental H-protein, then screened for mutations in the P-protein and T-protein genes, respectively.
