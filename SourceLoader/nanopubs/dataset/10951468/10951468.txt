Acampomelic campomelic dysplasia is a rare clinical variant of the more commonly encountered campomelic dysplasia (CMD1), characterized by absence of long bone curvature (acampomelia). We present a patient with acampomelic CMD1 with a de novo SOX9 missense mutation and report his clinical course to age one year, thereby contributing to genotype-phenotype correlation in CMD1. 2000.
