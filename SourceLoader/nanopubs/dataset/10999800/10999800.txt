Steroid 5alpha-reductase 2 deficiency is an autosomal recessive form of male pseudohermaphroditism caused by mutations in the SRD5A2 gene. In this study, we performed DNA analyses in two unrelated subjects bearing the enzyme deficiency and found differences in the mode of transmission for the disease. The data showed that in both families the fathers were carriers for an E197D mutation, whereas the mothers were carriers for a P212R mutation. Patient 1 was identified as compound heterozygote because he had both alterations (E197D/P212R). On the contrary, patient 2 was found to be homozygous, but only for the paternal mutation. Because this finding could not be explained on the basis ofnonpaternity or a chromosomal abnormality, the presence of uniparental disomy was suggested. The reduction to homozygosity for the E197D mutation, as confirmed by restriction analysis, supported this view. The results of our study give evidence of the first case of 5alpha-reductase deficiency resulting from uniparental disomy and also disclose an alternate mechanism whereby this enzymatic disorder can derive from a single parent.
