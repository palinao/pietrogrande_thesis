Paramyotonia congenita (PMC) of von Eulenburg is an autosomal dominant muscular disease characterized by exercise- and cold-induced myotonia and weakness. To date, 18 missense mutations in the adult skeletal muscle sodium channel alpha-subunit (SCN4A) gene have been identified to cause a spectrum of muscular diseases, including PMC of von Eulenburg, PMC without cold paralysis, potassium-aggravating myotonia, and hyperkalemic periodic paralysis. However, no obvious correlations can be made between the location or nature of amino acid substitutions in SCN4A and its clinical phenotypes.
