Most previous studies have failed to demonstrate any mutations in the type II 3beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD3B2) gene in patients satisfying the hormonal criteria of nonclassic 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency, suggesting that a mutant 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase protein is not the cause of this disorder. We screened the HSD3B2 gene for mutations in girls with premature pubarche and a hormonal diagnosis of 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency.
