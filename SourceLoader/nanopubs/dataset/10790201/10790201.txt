X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM; MIM# 310400) is a severe congenital muscle disorder caused by mutations in the MTM1 gene. This gene encodes a dual-specificity phosphatase named myotubularin, defining a large gene family highly conserved through evolution (which includes the putative anti-phosphatase Sbf1/hMTMR5). We report 29 mutations in novel cases, including 16 mutations not described before. To date, 198 mutations have been identified in unrelated families, accounting for 133 different disease-associated mutations which are widespread throughout the gene. Most point mutations are truncating, but 26% (35/133) are missense mutations affecting residues conserved in the Drosophila ortholog and in the homologous MTMR1 gene. Three recurrent mutations affect 17% of the patients, and a total of 21 different mutations were found in several independent families. The frequency of female carriers appears higher than expected (only 17% are de novo mutations). While most truncating mutations cause the severe and early lethal phenotype, some missense mutations are associated with milder forms and prolonged survival (up to 54 years).
