White sponge naevus (WSN) is a rare autosomal dominant condition which is characterised by benign, white spongy plaques (oral leukokeratoses) affecting non-cornifying, wet mucosa. WSN shares several ultrastructural characteristics (eg, epithelial thickening, acanthosis, keratin filament aggregation) with a number of epithelial disorders caused by mutations in keratin genes and to-date two mutations, one in each of the mucosal specific keratins, K4 and K13, have been identified as the molecular basis of the disorder.
