We have identified a family segregating von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease with a previously unreported T547A mutation in exon 1 of the VHL gene that causes a Tyr112 to Asn missense alteration in the protein. The mutation was identified by nucleotide sequencing and confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion. The mutation cosegregated with the disease in all five tested affected individuals from the extended family. The family consists of more than 100 at-risk individuals over seven generations. To date, we have identified 13 affected individuals of whom seven have had renal cell carcinoma and one has had a pheochromocytoma. No other case of a neuroendocrine tumor of the pancreas or adrenal gland (pheochromocytoma) was found or recognized retrospectively. Other manifestations in this family include retinal angioma and hemangioblastoma of the central nervous system. We also found the T547A mutation in three asymptomatic members of the family, ages 12, 19, and 20. Another mutation, T547C, which causes Tyr112 to His, has been seen at the same position and has been associated with VHL type 2A (pheochromocytoma, but no renal cell carcinoma) in two families with a total of 22 affected individuals [Chen F, Slife L, Kishida T, Mulvihill J, Tisherman SE, Zbar B, 1996: J Med Genet 33:716-717]. Thus, different amino acid changes at the same position can cause very distinct clinical phenotypes. It will be interesting to elucidate the functional differences that underlie the different phenotypes.
