The finding of extensive lytic lesions in the mandible of a 19-year-old Ashkenazi Jewish woman led to the diagnosis of Type 1 Gaucher disease. She had extensive skeletal involvement, marked hepatosplenomegaly, and deficient acid beta-glucosidase activity. Mutation analysis identified heteroallelism for acid beta-glucosidase mutations N370S and P401L, the latter being a novel missense mutation in exon 9. Expression of the P401L allele resulted in an enzyme with a reduced catalytic activity (specific activity based on cross-reacting immunological material approximately 0.21), which was similar to that of the mild N370S mutant enzyme. The expression studies predicted a mild phenotype for the proposita's N370S/P401L genotype which was inconsistent with her severe diffuse skeletal disease and organ involvement. Since lytic mandibular lesions may be complicated by osteomyelitis, pathologic fracture, and tooth loss, regular dental assessments in Type 1 Gaucher patients should be performed.
