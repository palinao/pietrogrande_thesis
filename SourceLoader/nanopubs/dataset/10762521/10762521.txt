Mutations in the gene coding for the Schwann cell transcription factor early growth response 2 (EGR2), which seems to regulate myelinogenesis and hindbrain development, have been observed in few cases of inherited neuropathy. The authors describe a unique combination of cranial nerve deficits in one member of a Charcot-Marie-Tooth 1 family carrying an EGR2 mutation (Arg381His). This finding further supports the role of EGR2 in cranial nerve development.
