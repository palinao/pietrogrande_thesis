Hyperekplexia (MIM 149400), or startle disease, is a neurological disorder characterized by generalized stiffness during the neonatal period, excessive startle reflexes, and generalized stiffness related to the startle response. Linkage analysis mapped a major gene for this disorder to chromosome 5q33-35. Subsequently, mutations in the GLRA1 gene, encoding the alpha1 subunit of the glycine receptor, were found in hyperekplexia families with an autosomal dominant or recessive inheritance pattern. In the present study, we describe the genetic analysis of the GLRA1 gene of a family consisting of 2 children with hyperekplexia, 2 nonaffected children, and their healthy nonconsanguineous parents. Although the pedigree suggested the presence of a recessive mutation, haplotype construction showed that the 2 affected children shared the same haplotype combination in which the maternal haplotype differed from the paternal haplotype, suggesting the presence of compound heterozygosity. Mutation analysis revealed different missense mutations on the two haplotypes, changing an arginine to a histidine at amino acid positions 252 and 392, respectively. It is interesting that the hyperekplexia phenotype was only seen in individuals compound heterozygous for the two mutations, whereas family members carrying either one of the two mutations had no clinical signs.
