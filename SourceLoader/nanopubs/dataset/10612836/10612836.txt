Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) is considered to be determined by germline mutations in the mismatch repair (MMR) genes, especially MSH2 and MLH1. While screening for mutations in these two genes in HNPCC portuguese families, 3 previously unreported MSH2 and 1 MLH1 mutations have been identified in families meeting strict Amsterdam criteria.
