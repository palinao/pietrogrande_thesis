Furthermore, we demonstrated that the expression of RyR2 associated proteins (including calmodulin, sorcin, calsequestrin, protein phosphatase 1, protein phosphatase 2A), Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA2a), PLB phosphorylation at Ser16 (PLB-S16), PLB phosphorylation at Thr17 (PLB-T17), L-type Ca(2+) channel (Cav1.2) and Na(+)- Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) were significantly reduced in rat HF
