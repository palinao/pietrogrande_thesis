To determine the prevalence of mutations in this gene in DBA and to begin to define the molecular basis for the observed variable clinical phenotype of this disorder, the genomic sequence of the 6 exons and the 5' untranslated region of the RPS19 gene was directly assessed in DBA index cases from 172 new families
