Real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed that the expression of mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) mRNA and that of 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 (11beta-HSD2) mRNA, which is known to confer aldosterone selectivity on MR, were upregulated in the untreated MI group, and that spironolactone significantly suppressed the expression of these genes
