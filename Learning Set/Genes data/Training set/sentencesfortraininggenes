P00037927 We conducted a genome-wide association study for type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Icelandic cases and controls, and we found that a previously described variant in the transcription factor 7-like 2 gene (TCF7L2) gene conferred the most significant risk
P00049164 We concluded that retinal Müller cells of RCS rats underwent an activation initiated by the onset of retinal degeneration before p60 and then an obvious reactive gliosis, which led the basic membrane properties to suffer marked changes, and caused the Kir4.1 channels of Müller cells to occur a clear functional shift, even lose their normal electrophysiological properties

P00045082 We conclude that in obesity the MNC is characterised by reduced p-INSR-beta and increased inflammatory mediators including IKBKB, PRKCB2 and SOCS3
P00044615 We conclude that hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with a decreased activity and expression of CBS in renal PTs because of the defect of chromosome 13 in SS rats

P00042235 Since transgenic overexpression of SOCS-3 in islets reduced the lipopenic effect of leptin by 75%, we conclude that the increased expression of SOCS-1 and -3 in WAT of rats with acquired obesity could have blocked leptin's lipopenic action in the leptin-resistant WAT population
