Our results demonstrate that thrombin increases brain ceruloplasmin levels and exogenous ceruloplasmin reduces ferrous iron-induced brain edema, suggesting that ceruloplasmin up-regulation may contribute to thrombin-induced brain tolerance to ICH by limiting the injury caused by ferrous iron released from the hematoma
