Both preventive (from Day 0 to Day 18) and therapeutic (from Day 7 to Day 18 or from Day 9 to Day 19) VPA (500 mg/kg, intra-gastric) administration to EAE rats once daily greatly reduced the severity and duration of EAE, and suppressed mRNA levels of interferon-γ (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-17, matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and transcription factor T-bet, but increased levels of IL-4 mRNA in EAE spinal cords
