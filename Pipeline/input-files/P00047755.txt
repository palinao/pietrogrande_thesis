Compared to the control group, the accumulated optical density (AOD) of GR immunoreactivity (IR) decreased significantly in the parietal cortex on postnatal day 13 (p&lt;0.05), the AOD of GR IR decreased significantly in the parietal cortex and the temporal cortex on postnatal day 15 (p&lt;0.05), and the AOD of GR IR decreased significantly in the parietal cortex, temporal cortex and the frontal cortex in the seizure group on postnatal day 19 (p&lt;0.05)
