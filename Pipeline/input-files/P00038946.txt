Using statistical models, we selected a total of 12 SNPs with P-values &lt;1 Ã— 10(-6) that were associated with DR. After controlling for diabetes duration and hemoglobin A(1C), 9 of the 12 SNPs located on 5 chromosomal regions were found to be associated with DR. Five loci not previously associated with DR susceptibility were identified in and around the following genes: MYSM1 (Myb-like, SWIRM, and MPN domains 1) located on chromosome 1p (odds ratio [O
