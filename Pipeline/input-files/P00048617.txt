The significant increase of fractalkine in mesenteric lymph nodes (P&lt;0.05) and its receptor (CX3CR1) in the small bowel (P&lt;0.05) and hippocampus (P&lt;0.01), associated with the increased expression of SDF1-Î± in the hippocampus (P&lt;0.01) and the cerebellum (P&lt;0.01) suggest that prehepatic portal hypertension in the rat induces important alterations in the expression of chemokines in the gut-brain axis
